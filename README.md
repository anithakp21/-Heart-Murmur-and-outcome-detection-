This project is devoted to detecting the presence or absence of murmurs from multiple heart sound recordings from multiple auscultation locations as well as detecting the clinical outcomes.
Made use of Machine Learning algorthims and Deep Learning architetcures for the detection of heart murmurs like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, ResNet-50, EfficientNey-b4
